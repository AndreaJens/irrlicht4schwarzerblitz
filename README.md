# irrlicht4schwarzerblitz
My personal version of the [irrlicht game engine](https://irrlicht.sourceforge.io/), modified to fit the Schwarzerblitz engine, to be used to compile the [Schwarzerblitz Engine](https://github.com/AndreaJens/SchwarzerblitzEngine).
The license is functionally equivalent to a BSD 3-clauses license, thus compatible with GNU Public License 3.

# Important note
Requires a correctly installed [DirectX 9 Legacy SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812) for compilation.
